## Tech used

This project was developed with <a href="https://astro.build/" target=_blank>Astro</a>, using a mix of HTML, Typescript, CSS and some Javascript.

After considering a few options to build and develop this project, <a href="https://astro.build/" target=_blank>Astro</a> was ultimately chosen due to a few reasons:

- First of all, a <a href="https://react.dev/" target=_blank>React</a> based framework was decided, as opposed to something like <a href="https://angular.dev/" target=_blank>Angular</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target=_blank>Vue.js</a>, due to my familiarity to <a href="https://react.dev/" target=_blank>React</a> and its current wide use in the field;
- Due to the simple nature of the project, it being only showcasing my projects and some of my information, pretty much entirely out of text and images (static content), a more complex framework, like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target=_blank>Next.js</a> or <a href="https://remix.run/" target=_blank>Remix</a>, would be overkill and unnecessary, and were therefore discarded as optimal choices;
- Next, the best choices for static content rendering were <a href="https://astro.build/" target=_blank>Astro</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target=_blank>Gastby</a>, <a href="https://astro.build/" target=_blank>Astro</a> being ultimately chosen, due to being more performant;
